The installed guest reports hw.model=iMac14,2, so the override reaches the installed system and not only the installer (docs/install-log.md). A 2013 Haswell iMac paired with a Penryn guest CPU, which 10.9 evidently tolerates.`},
	{"MacPro5,1", "PANICKED", `PANICS UNDER KVM in AppleTyMCEDriver, BOOTS UNDER TCG, AND AS OF 2026-09-22 WE KNOW WHY. Three observations under KVM on pet-power-plant (i7-8700B Coffee Lake, NOT a Xeon): 2026-09-17 P1, the INSTALLER panicked under khronokernel's OpenCore 0.6.6 and UTM firmware; 2026-09-21, an ALREADY-INSTALLED 10.9.5 guest on OUR OpenCore 1.0.7, OUR OVMF and OUR config.plist panicked at 40 s; 2026-09-22, reproduced again on a fresh overlay of the SSH-capable pipeline image as a one-variable control -- panic at 40 s, no SSH in 180 s where the default SMBIOS answers in 20-40 s. Also PANICKED on ap-juicer, which IS a Xeon 5150, so it is not about the host CPU. THE CAUSE IS MEASURED AND IT IS NOT THE SMBIOS AND NOT THE HOST. The panic dump prints the CPU registers and RCX is 0x0000000000000280. RCX is the MSR index register for rdmsr/wrmsr and 0x280 is IA32_MC0_CTL2, the first CMCI control register -- which is what a function called enableInterruptForCorrectableMemoryCoreRegister touches. KVM dispatches 0x280-0x29F to get_msr_mce/set_msr_mce, which return 1 (NOT the KVM_MSR_RET_UNSUPPORTED sentinel) when MCG_CMCI_P is clear, so the #GP is injected without ignore_msrs ever being consulted and without any dmesg line. QEMU never sets MCG_CMCI_P. Since Linux commit 281b5278, first released in v6.0 on 2022-10-02. THE CONTROL THAT PROVES IT: the same overlay, the same OpenCore image, the same -cpu line, ONE variable -- -accel tcg instead of -accel kvm -- booted and answered SSH at 80 s, reporting sw_vers 10.9.5 and hw.model MacPro5,1. TCG emulates the MSR instead of delegating it. So this row is a property of KVM's machine-check emulation, not of Mavericks and not of this hardware. WHAT WOULD FALSIFY THE EXPLANATION: a host kernel older than 6.0 with ignore_msrs=1, where 0x280 still fell through to the ignore path -- MacPro5,1 should boot there and dmesg should name 0x280. No host in the fleet is old enough. See docs/configuration-register.md, docs/host-profile.md G14, docs/decisions/0010.`},
