# Lab log

Append-only. Newest entries at the bottom. Every command tried, what happened,
any panic text, and what fixed it. **Failures are as valuable as successes** —
a dead end that isn't written down gets walked into twice.

Format per entry: date, phase, what was attempted, the exact command, the
outcome, and the conclusion drawn.

## 2026-09-17 — P0 — host probe

Probed the host before designing. Full results in `docs/host-profile.md`.

```
lscpu; ls -l /dev/kvm; id; qemu-system-x86_64 --version
ls /usr/share/OVMF/; cat /etc/os-release; free -g; df -h /home/schmonz
cat /sys/class/dmi/id/{sys_vendor,product_name,board_name}
uname -a; ls /sys/kernel/iommu_groups | wc -l; lspci -nn | grep -iE 'vga|3d|display'
```

Outcome: `Macmini8,1`, i7-8700B (Coffee Lake, 6C/12T), 62 GB RAM, 1.7 TB free,
T2 chip, Mint 22.3 on kernel `7.2.6-1-t2-noble`, VT-x present, `/dev/kvm`
usable by the user via group `kvm`, IOMMU on with 14 groups, QEMU 8.2.2,
OVMF 4M-split only, Intel UHD 630 as the sole display device.

Conclusions:

- The AMD hard-stop does not trigger. Intel with VT-x, KVM usable without
  further permission work.
- The host is Apple hardware, so virtualizing OS X here is licensed.
- No PCIe slots and one iGPU, so GPU passthrough is off the table. Recorded
  as `docs/decisions/0001-no-gpu-passthrough.md`.
- OVMF is 4M split CODE/VARS only, with no combined image. Flagged as a risk
  for P3, since the UTM bundle's firmware is most likely a combined older
  image.
- The `t2` kernel is unusual and worth remembering whenever something behaves
  oddly.

Not yet done: `kvm.ignore_msrs=1`, which needs `sudo` and therefore an ask.
