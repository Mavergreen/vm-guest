# Try partitions before the whole disk. A bare filesystem image lives at
# /dev/vda, but a GPT-partitioned disk -- which is what real installer
# media is -- puts it on /dev/vda1. Trying only the whole disk fails with
# a bare "mount failed" that says nothing about why.
#
# And check that the mount is WRITABLE, which is not the same as the mount
# succeeding. Linux's hfsplus driver silently falls back to read-only for a
# volume whose header does not say it was cleanly unmounted -- the normal
# state of any media a QEMU guest has booted, because powering a VM off is
# not a clean unmount. The symptom is a successful mount followed by
# "Read-only file system" from every chown, which reads like a permissions
# problem and is not one.
#
# -o force is tried, and for this particular cause it does NOT help:
# hfsplus_fill_super applies force only to the SOFTLOCK and JOURNALED
# branches, and takes the "was not cleanly unmounted" branch first. The
# repair is to mark the volume clean in its two volume headers, which
# hfs_mark_clean in lib/hfs.sh does from the host without privilege. Say so
# here rather than leave a reader to find that out from kernel source.
