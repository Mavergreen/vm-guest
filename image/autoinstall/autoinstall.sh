# Prepare the target disk for an unattended Mavericks install.
#
# WHERE THIS RUNS
#
# Injected onto the installer media as /private/etc/rc.cdrom.local, which
# Apple's own /etc/rc.install sources early in the installer environment:
#
#     39: if [ -x /etc/rc.cdrom.local ]; then
#     40:     /etc/rc.cdrom.local
#
# This is a supported hook, not a hole we found. Note that /etc/rc.cdrom
# does NOT source it -- rc.cdrom reaches rc.install via `launchctl load
# -D system`, so reading only rc.cdrom makes the hook look absent. It is
# not; see the P4 Task 5 entry in NOTES.md.
#
# WHAT IT DOES, AND WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT
#
# It prepares the disk and nothing else. The install itself is Apple's:
# /System/Installation/Packages/Extras/minstallconfig.xml puts the OS X
# Installer into its own automated mode, and rc.install reboots when that
# finishes. So there is no `installer -pkg` call here, and no `shutdown`
# -- both would be us reimplementing something already present.
#
# By the time this runs, rc.cdrom has already mounted RAM disks over
# /Volumes, /var/tmp and /var/run, and remounted the root (the media)
# read-only. So /var/tmp is writable and the media is not.
#
# CHOOSING THE TARGET
#
# Three disks are attached: the installer media we booted from, the
# OpenCore EFI image, and the disk to install onto. Upstream
# (timsutton/osx-vm-templates) hardcodes diskN with a fallback to the next
# one, which is fine for a VM with one disk and unsafe here.
#
# The key is being UNPARTITIONED. The media and the OpenCore image both
# carry partition tables; a freshly created target has nothing but zeroes,
# so `diskutil list` shows it with no slices at all. Size is a secondary
# guard. If that does not name exactly one disk, this script erases
# nothing and stops -- see the comment on `give_up` for why stopping means
# sleeping rather than exiting.

# partitions. Mavericks itself lands at about 8.5 GiB, so anything smaller
