# Re-fetch and re-verify every vendor/sources.tsv entry this branch changed.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS, AND WHY IT IS NOT OPTIONAL
#
# Each line of vendor/sources.tsv is a URL and a sha256 of what that URL
# returns. Renovate can move the URL; it cannot compute the checksum. So a
# bump PR arrives with a new version and an old hash -- a pin that is
# internally inconsistent and will fail at fetch time, half an hour into
# somebody's build.
#
# Without this check that PR is GREEN, because nothing else in the suite
# downloads anything, and the shared Renovate policy automerges green PRs.
# That would turn "track the ingredient" into "break the ingredient
# automatically", which is worse than not tracking it. With this check the
# PR is red until a human fetches the artifact, reads what changed and pins
# the new checksum -- which for the boot stack is the review we want anyway
# (see .github/renovate.json's packageRule).
#
# It is deliberately scoped to CHANGED lines. Re-downloading the whole
# registry on every run is several gigabytes and would make the check the
# reason nobody runs the suite.
#
#   usage: bin/verify-changed-sources.sh [base-ref]
#
# With no base-ref it compares against the merge base with origin/main, and
# skips cleanly when there is no such ref -- a fresh clone with no remote
# has nothing to diff against, and a check that fails there is a check that
# gets deleted.
