# The version scheme: YYYYMMDD.N.
#
# spec: docs/decisions/0012-version-scheme.md
#
# This product is its OWN upstream -- it is not a repackage of somebody
# else's release -- so it takes the family's self-upstream shape
# (mavericks-porthole, mavericks-magic-trackpad2) and drops the
# -mavericks suffix, which has no slot to fill. UPSTREAM_VERSION holds
# this product's own version line as a date; N counts the releases cut
# on that line, INCLUDING ingredient-only repackages. So the date is not
# the release date -- it is the version line's name.
#
# The family's shared scripts/version.sh and resolve-version.sh are not
# usable here: both hardcode the literal "-mavericks." that the port
# shape needs. mavericks-porthole inlines the equivalent logic in its
# release.yml; ours is a committed script instead, so that it can be
# tested (tests/version.bats).
