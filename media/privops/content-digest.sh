# shellcheck shell=sh
# This runs under busybox ash inside the microVM, not under the host's
# shell, and it is sourced-by-path rather than executed -- hence a shell
# directive instead of a shebang.
#
# Runs as uid 0 inside the privops microVM. The volume to digest is
# mounted READ-ONLY at $MQG_SRC1; $MQG_RAW2 is a raw block device the
# listing is written to, which on the host is a plain file.
#
# Prints, on the console:
#   MQG-DIGEST-FILES   <n>       files found
#   MQG-DIGEST-HASHED  <n>       files sha256summed (must equal the above)
#   MQG-DIGEST-BYTES   <n>       total bytes of those files
#   MQG-DIGEST-SIZE    <n>       bytes of listing written to the raw disk
#   MQG-DIGEST-SHA256  <sha256>  of the listing, as the guest read it back
#
# WHY THE LISTING GOES OUT ON A RAW DISK AND NOT THE CONSOLE
#
# It is about four megabytes for real installer media -- 39,000 lines --
# and the console is a 16550 emulated one character at a time. The raw
# disk is the same channel media/build-installer-img.sh brings
# BaseSystem.dmg out on, run in the same direction, and the host checks
# the sha256 above against its own read of the file, so a short or torn
# write is caught rather than digested.
#
# WHY NOT AS ROOT... IS NOT AN OPTION, AND IT CHANGES THE ANSWER
#
# The host's old udisks mount ran as an ordinary user, so BaseSystem's
# /.file -- mode 0000, the marker OS X looks for to decide a volume has a
# filesystem on it -- could not be read and was listed as
# "UNREADABLE-<size>  <path>" instead of hashed. In here we are uid 0 and
# it reads fine, so it gets a real checksum like everything else and there
# is no unreadable category left. Digests taken before 2026-09-21 are
# therefore NOT comparable with these. That is a better answer, not merely
# a different one: the old listing said something about who ran the tool.
#
# A file that cannot be read for some other reason -- an I/O error off a
# corrupt volume -- would make sha256sum print nothing for it and carry
# on, which would silently shrink the digest's input. So the files are
# counted before they are hashed and both counts are reported: the host
# refuses a digest whose two numbers disagree.
