# shellcheck shell=sh
# This runs under busybox ash inside the microVM, not under the host's
# shell, and it is sourced-by-path rather than executed -- hence a shell
# directive instead of a shebang.
#
# Runs as uid 0 inside the privops microVM.
#   $MQG_SRC1  the ESD volume, read-only
#   $MQG_RAW2  a raw disk the host will read back as a plain file
#   $MQG_MNT   the target image. NOT TOUCHED HERE, and mounted only
#              because the backend always mounts its first disk.
#
# WHY THIS PASS EXISTS AT ALL
#
# The media's root filesystem is the contents of BaseSystem.dmg, which
# lives *inside* the ESD volume and is UDIF-compressed: only dmg2img can
# decode it, dmg2img runs on the host, and the host cannot read the ESD
# volume without mounting it -- which is precisely what this project can no
# longer do (G26: udisks2 grants loop-setup to a user at a seat, and a
# headless host has none).
#
# So the one file the host still needs out of the ESD comes out the only
# way anything can leave the microVM without a host mount: written to a
# raw disk, which is a plain file on the other side. The host truncates it
# to the length reported here and runs dmg2img on it.
#
# The digest is printed so the host can check its own read of that file
# against what the guest sent. A silent short write would otherwise turn
# into a dmg2img failure that says nothing about where the bytes went.
