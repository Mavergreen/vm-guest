// Package lock is vmavs's build lock: a directory holding its holder's
// pid, created by renaming a temporary directory -- pid file and all --
// into place, so that it is never visible without its pid. A lock whose
// holder is no longer running is stale, and is taken over rather than
// left to block every later build (spec §5, "Locks").
//
// Rename is by path, and cannot be made conditional on what is at the
// path, so acquisition -- judging the lock, taking a stale one over,
// sweeping this package's own leftovers -- is serialised by a short
// flock(2) on the parent directory. That flock is held for a few system
// calls, never for the build, and leaves no file behind. Where a
// filesystem refuses it, Acquire goes on without it and says so
// (Lock.Serialized): a fresh lock still has one holder, but two takers
// of one stale lock can then both win.
//
// It is NOT shared with the shell tree's builders. They lock with a
// similar shape (media/build-installer-img.sh), but at their own paths --
// media/installer-linux.img.lock, where vmavs's media lock is
// build/installer-media.img.lock, even with VMAVS_HOME set to the shell
// tree's home -- and they neither take the flock nor sweep. Nothing may
// rely on this lock excluding another implementation's builder, or on
// its files being read by one.
