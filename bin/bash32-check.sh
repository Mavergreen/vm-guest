#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Fail if any shell file here uses a bash feature newer than 3.2.
#
# WHY 3.2, WHICH IS FROM 2006
#
# Stock OS X 10.9 Mavericks ships /bin/bash 3.2.57 -- the last GPLv2
# release, frozen by Apple in 2007 and never updated. A sibling project,
# mavericks-hypervisor, is back-porting Hypervisor.framework to 10.9 so
# modern QEMU gets HVF acceleration there. When that lands, the obvious
# next thing someone will want is to run THIS project's host-side CLI on a
# Mavericks host, to build and run a Mavericks guest. Keeping that option
# open costs about fifteen lines today. Reopening it after a year of
# accumulated bash 4 habits costs a great deal more.
#
# WHAT THE RULE IS NOT
#
# This is not "we only support bash 3.2". Every shebang in this repository
# is `#!/usr/bin/env bash`, so a pkgsrc or Homebrew bash 5 earlier in PATH
# satisfies every script here regardless of what is in /bin. The floor
# binds against exactly one thing: WHAT APPLE SHIPPED. It says a 10.9 user
# who has not installed a newer bash can still run these scripts.
#
# Know that before you either over-apply this rule (it has nothing to say
# about anything but shell syntax) or delete it (the bash in /bin on 10.9
# is not going to get any newer).
#
# HOW IT CHECKS
#
# Line-oriented pattern matching, in-process, with no external tools.
# This is not shellcheck's job, and it cannot be made to be: as of 0.9 it
# has no bash-version floor to express. Its `--shell` flag selects a
# dialect (sh, bash, dash, ksh), not a version, and the SC3xxx portability
# checks are all-or-nothing against `sh` -- turning those on would reject
# the bash-3.2 features this project does use and rightly wants.
#
# (If you rewrite the paragraph above, do not let a line begin with that
# tool's name. A comment whose first word is that name is read as a
# directive, and the file then fails SC1073 for a sentence about it.)
#
# Comment lines are skipped, so prose about `mapfile` does not trip the
# check on a file that no longer calls it. A line carrying the marker
# `bash32-allow` is skipped too; the pattern table below needs it, since
# the patterns necessarily spell out the words they look for.
#
# LIMITS
#
# This is textual. It catches the constructs listed below, which is what
# the codebase actually reached for; it cannot catch a bash 4 builtin
# invoked through a variable, and it cannot see runtime-only breakage at
# all. The one runtime-only trap worth knowing about, because this
# codebase hit it: before bash 4.4, expanding an EMPTY array under `set -u`
# -- `"${arr[@]}"` -- is an "unbound variable" error rather than nothing.
# Write `${arr[@]+"${arr[@]}"}` wherever the array can be empty. No grep
# can tell which arrays those are, so that one is on the reader.

# "<extended regex>|<what to write instead>". Each pattern is matched
# against one line at a time with `[[ =~ ]]`, which is bash 3.0 and so
# usable here.
#
# Every entry carries the bash32-allow marker: a pattern for `mapfile` has
# to contain the string `mapfile`, and without the marker this table would
# be the first thing the check reported.
#
# SC2016 (expressions do not expand in single quotes) is exactly the point
# here: every entry is a literal regex and a literal sentence, and the `$`
# and backticks in them are meant to reach the reader unexpanded.
