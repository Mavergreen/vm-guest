# What Setup Assistant would have done, done once, with nobody watching.
#
# WHERE THIS RUNS
#
# On the installed Mavericks system, as root, on its first boot, launched by
# /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.mqg.firstboot.plist. Both this script and that
# plist are put there at install time by ./postinstall, which the OS X
# Installer runs because mqg-firstboot.pkg is listed in
# OSInstall.collection -- so the payload is installed *as part of the
# install*, not injected into a finished volume afterwards.
#
# WHAT IT IS A SPECIFICATION OF
#
# docs/install-log.md's "First boot and Setup Assistant" section: the list
# of what Setup Assistant actually asks. That log exists so this script
# could be written against something observed rather than remembered.
#
# IT RUNS EXACTLY ONCE
#
# The last thing it does is remove its own LaunchDaemon. A first-boot script
# that runs on every boot silently undoes manual changes for the rest of the
# image's life, and the symptom turns up long after the cause. Removing the
# plist is therefore not tidiness, it is the safety property.
#
# NOTHING HERE MAY HANG FOREVER
#
# This is a 2013 OS that may be talking to Apple's 2026 servers. Every step
# runs under run_with_timeout and every failure is non-fatal: a payload that
# skips a nicety is better than a payload that never finishes and leaves an
# image with no account on it.

# --- Apple's post-10.9.5 updates ------------------------------------------
#
# WHY THESE ARE HERE AND NOT RUN BY `softwareupdate`
#
# `softwareupdate` would talk to Apple's servers from inside the guest, on
# every first boot, in 2026. The answer would be whatever Apple serves that
# day, the image would stop being reproducible, and a 2013 OS negotiating
# with 2026 servers may hang. Every package installed below is a standalone
# .pkg pinned by checksum in vendor/sources.tsv, carried on the installer
# media and copied here by ./postinstall. See image/fetch-updates.sh.
#
# WHY BEFORE OPENSSH, WHICH IS NOT A STYLE CHOICE
#
# Security Update 2016-004's own Payload contains ./usr/bin/ssh and
# ./usr/sbin/sshd -- read out of the package, not assumed. Installed after
# the OpenSSH System-Replace package it would overwrite the symlinks that
# package puts at those paths, and the guest would quietly fall back to
# OpenSSH 6.2 -- or, if launchd's ssh job ended up pointing at something
# that no longer resolved, answer nothing at all. So: updates first, the
# family's OpenSSH second, and the openssh_usable check below then judges
# the state the guest is actually left in.
#
# WHAT SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE, AND WHAT IT DOES NOT
#
# `sw_vers` still says 10.9.5 afterwards, because ProductVersion IS 10.9.5
# -- 2016-004 is a security update, not a point release. A zero exit from
# `installer` is not evidence either. The two witnesses this script records
# are the ones that actually move:
#
#   * a RECEIPT: `pkgutil --pkgs` gains
#     com.apple.pkg.update.security.2016-004Mavericks.13F1911
#   * a BUILD NUMBER: the update carries SystemVersion.plist, so
#     `sw_vers -buildVersion` goes 13F34 -> 13F1911
#
# Both are logged below, before and after, so the log says what happened
# rather than what was attempted.
#
# A RESTART IS WANTED AND IS NOT TAKEN HERE
#
# 2016-004's PackageInfo declares postinstall-action="restart". This script
# does not reboot: the install stage powers the guest down when SSH answers
# and every later boot is a cold one, so the restart happens anyway, once,
# without this script racing the thing that is watching for SSH.

# --- the family's own OpenSSH ---------------------------------------------
#
# WHAT THIS FIXES
#
# Stock 10.9 is OpenSSH 6.2p2. Ed25519 arrived in 6.5, so a modern key in
# authorized_keys is a line this sshd cannot parse -- "Permission denied
# (publickey)" from a server that is otherwise working perfectly. And 6.2
# offers only ssh-rsa and ssh-dss host keys, which a 2026 client refuses
# outright. Both cost a full install to find; see NOTES.md.
#
# Mavergreen/openssh already builds current OpenSSH for 10.9. The
# packages travel on the installer media and ./postinstall copied them to
# $CONF_DIR/pkgs at install time -- read that file for why they are not
# listed in OSInstall.collection.
#
# ORDER MATTERS, TWICE
#
# 1. Base package first, replacement second: the replacement symlinks the
#    system paths at files the base package installs.
# 2. This whole block runs BEFORE Remote Login is enabled. ssh.plist is an
#    inetd-style job: launchd holds the listening socket and execs
#    /usr/libexec/sshd-keygen-wrapper per connection, so the very first
#    connection already gets the new sshd and nothing has to be restarted
#    underneath a live session.
#
# THE WRAPPER WE WRITE OURSELVES, AND WHY
#
# 10.9's /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/ssh.plist names
# /usr/libexec/sshd-keygen-wrapper as its Program. The replacement
# package's postinstall symlinks that path to
# /usr/local/libexec/sshd-keygen-wrapper -- but its payload does not
# contain that file (checked: the published 10.5p1-mavericks.2 Payload has
# no sshd-keygen-wrapper). The symlink therefore dangles, launchd cannot
# exec it, and the guest ends up with NO working sshd at all.
#
# So we write it, before installing the replacement, and the symlink lands
# on a real file. Ours also does the other thing a 10.9 guest needs:
# Apple's wrapper only ever generates rsa1/rsa/dsa host keys in /etc, and a
# modern sshd reads /usr/local/etc/ssh_host_{rsa,ecdsa,ed25519}_key. Without
# an Ed25519 host key the second defect above is only half fixed.
#
# EXIT CONDITION: delete write_sshd_keygen_wrapper when
# Mavergreen/openssh ships a sshd-keygen-wrapper of its own. Until
# then this is a compensation for a sibling defect, stated as one.

# The first version called `launchctl unload "$DAEMON"` and then `rm -f`.
# Unloading the job that is running this script terminates the script, so
# the `rm` never happened: the log ended at the line above, the plist stayed
# in /Library/LaunchDaemons, and every later boot started firstboot.sh
# again. The marker below is what made that harmless -- it is the second
# guard, and it is the one that held when the first one broke. Both are
# worth keeping for exactly that reason.
#
# There is nothing to unload anyway. The job has no KeepAlive, so launchd
# does not restart it, and removing the plist means there is no job at the
# next boot.
