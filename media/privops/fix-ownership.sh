# rsync ran unprivileged, so everything arrived owned by the building user,
# and launchd refuses to load daemons from a directory it does not trust:
# "Dubious ownership on file (skipping)" then "nothing found to load". Apple
# ships this media uniformly root-owned, so that is what we restore.
#
# The catch: chown clears setuid and setgid bits. The reference media has
# six such files and one of them -- Install.framework's `runner` -- belongs
# to the installer itself. So record them first and restore them after.
#
# The list lives in a shell variable rather than a temp file, because the
# initramfs has no writable /tmp and six entries do not need one.
