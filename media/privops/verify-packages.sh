# shellcheck shell=sh
# This runs under busybox ash inside the microVM, not under the host's
# shell, and it is sourced-by-path rather than executed -- hence a shell
# directive instead of a shebang.
#
# Runs as uid 0 inside the privops microVM, the finished media mounted at
# $MQG_MNT. Prints one "MQG-SUM-MEDIA <sha256>  <name>" line per file in
# System/Installation/Packages and nothing else; the host compares them
# against media/apple-packages.sha256.
#
# WHY THE READ HAPPENS HERE, AND IN A MICROVM OF ITS OWN
#
# Three media builds in six put a corrupt copy of Apple's Essentials.pkg
# on the media -- 3.2 GB, half of everything there -- while rsync reported
# success and the entry and byte counts matched. The first version of the
# check passed on that media, because it compared source to destination
# through the same mount that had just written the file: it read the page
# cache, not the disk.
#
# So this is a separate boot from the one that did the writing. Not merely
# a fresh mount -- a fresh kernel, with no page cache at all, reading
# through virtio from the file on the host. Every byte has to come off the
# disk. That is strictly more than the host's old fresh-mount check could
# promise, and it is the check G20 exists to keep working.
