# It used to run on the host: udisks2 attached a loop device, mounted the
# volumes under /run/media/$USER, and rsync did the copying. That needs a
# desktop seat (G26) -- polkit refuses loop-setup over SSH -- and it put
# file-browser windows and notification popups on the screen of anyone who
# had one. Here there is no loop device and no host mount at all.

# Runs as uid 0 with:
#   $MQG_MNT   the target volume, read-write
#   $MQG_SRC1  the BaseSystem volume, read-only
#   $MQG_SRC2  the ESD volume, read-only
#   $MQG_RAW3  optional: a tar of files to inject, already named for
#              where they go on the media. Absent when the build was not
#              asked for any.

# NOTHING HERE CHOWNS ANYTHING. Ownership is media/privops/fix-ownership.sh
# in a pass of its own, after every write, because it has to record the
# setuid and setgid modes before the chown that strips them and restore
# them afterwards -- a destructive step must not run before the code that
# makes it reversible.
