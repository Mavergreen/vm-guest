# The one conformance check that is ours alone: A RELEASE MUST CONTAIN NO
# APPLE-DERIVED BYTES.
#
# WHY THIS IS A GATE AND NOT A HABIT
#
# "Never publish the guest image" and "the OS comes from Apple only" are
# the two rules this project cannot get wrong once. Both are currently
# satisfied by construction: we ship a recipe, and the recipe fetches
# Apple's InstallESD.dmg at RUNTIME, on the user's machine, from Apple.
# Nothing Apple-derived is ever committed.
#
# Satisfied-by-construction is exactly the condition under which a rule
# quietly stops being true. A 6 GB .dmg committed "just for a minute" to
# debug something, a BaseSystem extract left in a fixtures directory, a
# kext copied out of a guest -- each is one `git add -A` away, and none of
# them looks wrong in a diff that is already large. The cost of checking is
# a second per CI run. The cost of finding out later is a DMCA notice.
#
# WHAT IT CHECKS
#
# Exactly what a release would contain: what `git archive REF` would
# package -- REF's tree, not the working directory. Give it a ref (a tag,
# almost always) and it checks exactly that tree via `git ls-tree`,
# `git cat-file` and `git show REF:path`. Give it nothing and it checks
# the index instead, which is today's pre-release approximation of the
# same tree. Either way, an untracked InstallESD.dmg beside the repo is
# how this project is MEANT to work (see decisions/0003: images live on
# local disk, outside the repo) and must never redden either mode.
#
# A ref that does not resolve is a FAILURE, not a pass: cannot-verify is
# not the same answer as verified-clean, and a release gate that
# green-lights because it could not find the tag is worse than no gate.
# The same rule applies one level down, per file: a blob this script
# cannot read (a stripped loose object, a listing command that itself
# failed) is flagged rather than silently skipped -- see check 0 below.
#
#   usage: bin/no-apple-bytes.sh [ref]     (default: the working tree's index)

# The tracked-file list, built once into a scratch file rather than piped
# straight into each `while read`, for two reasons:
#
#   1. `-z` (NUL-delimited), not the default newline-delimited listing.
#      Without it, `git ls-tree`/`git ls-files` C-QUOTES any path holding a
#      non-ASCII byte, a double quote, a backslash or a tab -- `é.dmg`
#      comes back as the literal eleven characters `"\303\251.dmg"`, which
#      matches none of section 1's `*.dmg` patterns, and is not a path
#      `git show`/`git cat-file` can open either (they want the real
#      bytes, not their octal-escaped spelling). `-z` sidesteps quoting
#      entirely, and `read -r -d ''` on the reading end handles it --
#      both bash 3.0-era features.
#   2. The listing command's OWN exit status is checked, not `|| true`'d
#      away. A `git ls-tree`/`git ls-files` that fails outright would
#      otherwise print nothing, every `while read` loop below would then
#      iterate zero times, and the script would exit 0 having "checked" an
#      empty list -- cannot-verify reading as clean, same failure mode as
#      the unresolved-ref case above, one layer down.
